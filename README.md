# MNIST-Digit-Classifier
CNN Digit Classification with MNIST Dataset

**Project Overview**
This project builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The CNN model is designed to recognize digits from 0 to 9 and is trained using the Keras library.

**Project Structure**
Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
Model Construction: Design a CNN with two convolutional layers followed by dense layers.
Training: Train the model on the MNIST training dataset.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s performance using the test dataset and visualize results with a confusion matrix.
